markdown-helper: |
  Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {} has some enhancements, to make sure that saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.\n
  <b>Supported Markdown:</b>
  - <code>__italic__</code>: Double underscores will produce <i>italic</i> text.
  - <code>**bold**</code>: Double asterisks will produce <b>bold</b> text.
  - <code>`code`</code>: Backticks will produce <code>monospace</code> text.
  - <code>~~strike~~</code>: Double tildes will produce <del>strikethrough</del> text.
  - <code>--underline--</code> Double Hyphen will produce <u>underline</u> text.
  - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double pipes will produce <spoiler>spoiler</spoiler> text.
  - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link. the message will just show sometext, and tapping on it will open the page at someURL.
  EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>
  - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: This is the formatting to create a telegram button. buttontext will be what is displayed on the button, and someurl will be the url to redirect.
  EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:google.com)</code>

  If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
  <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
  <code>[two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
  This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

  Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!
filling-format-helper: |
  You can customize the content of a text with the event context as well. For example, you want to mention user who joined the chat.

  Supported filling format:
  - `{first}`: The users first name.
  - `{last}`: The users last name.
  - `{fullname}`: The users full name.
  - `{username}`: The users username. Mention if user doesn't have a username.
  - `{mention}`: Mentions the user.
  - `{id}`: The users id.
  - `{chatname}`: The current chat name.

federations-help: |
  Group management. It's all fun and games, until you start getting spammers in, and you need to ban them. Then you need to start banning more, and more, and it gets painful.
  But then you have multiple groups, and you don't want these spammers in any of your groups - how can you deal? Do you have to ban them manually, in all your groups?

  No more! With federations, you can make a ban in one chat overlap to all your other chats.
  You can even appoint federation admins, so that your trustworthiest admins can ban across all the chats that you want to protect.

  **Commands available:**
  × /newfed <name>: Create a new federation with the specified name.

  × /fedrestore: export a federation backup file to restore banned users (PM Only).
  × /subfed <fedID>: Subscribe to other federation. Users banned in the subscribed federation will be banned in your federation too.
  Note: This doesn't affect your federation banlist. It only inherits the bans from the subscribed federation.
  × /unsubfed <fedID>: Unsubscribe your federation from another. Bans from the other fed will no longer take effect.
